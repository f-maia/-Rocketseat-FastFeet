## Getting Started
In order to use FastFeet's frontend you will need to configure the [backend][201] first.

*Please, stick to only one package manager to run all commands on the application.*

### NPM
If your are using npm you will need to run `npm install` and wait it to finish installing all the dependencies, after that you can run `npm start` to use FastFeet admin portal.

### Yarn
If your are using yarn you will need to run `yarn` and wait it to finish installing all the dependencies, after that you can run `npm  start` to use FastFeet admin portal.

### Usage
Now with the application running you can start using it! To access all pages your user login will be:

> email: `admin@fasfeet.com`\
> password: `123456`

*As this app was built with [create-react-app][202] it has all scripts generate by CRA available.*
